#
# Bump pi-forge to a new version.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Validates the new version is SemVer-shaped (x.y.z, optionally
#      followed by a pre-release like -rc.1).
#   2. Refuses to run on a dirty working tree — a release commit must
#      be reproducible from `main`, not contaminated with WIP.
#   3. Refuses to run if the new version is older than or equal to
#      the current root version (catches `1.0.0 -> 0.9.9` typos).
#   4. Refuses to run if `## [Unreleased]` in CHANGELOG.md is empty
#      (a bump with no changelog entry usually means "I forgot to
#      record what's in this release"). Override with --allow-empty.
#   5. Updates the `version` field in:
#        - package.json
#        - packages/server/package.json
#        - packages/client/package.json
#      All three must move in lockstep — the release workflow tags
#      against the root version and the Docker image is built from
#      the same commit, so a drifted workspace version would ship
#      mislabeled artifacts.
#   6. In CHANGELOG.md, renames `## [Unreleased]` to
#      `## [<new-version>] — YYYY-MM-DD` and inserts a fresh empty
#      `## [Unreleased]` heading above it for the next cycle.
#   7. Stages the changes and prints next-step instructions. Does
#      NOT commit, push, or tag — those are intentional, manual
#      checkpoints.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bump-version.sh 1.0.1
#   scripts/bump-version.sh 1.1.0-rc.1 --allow-empty
#
# Requires: bash 3.2+ (works with the macOS system bash), node (for
# the JSON edits — using `node -e` avoids a jq dependency since node
# is already required to build the project).

Done. Review staged changes:
  git diff --cached

Then commit on a release branch:
  git checkout -b release/v$NEW_VERSION
  git commit -m "chore(release): v$NEW_VERSION"
  git push -u origin release/v$NEW_VERSION
  gh pr create --base main --title "chore(release): v$NEW_VERSION" --fill

After the PR merges into main, tag from main:
  git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
  git tag v$NEW_VERSION
  git push origin v$NEW_VERSION

The release workflow will build the multi-arch image and create the
GitHub Release automatically.
