/**
 * Inbox surface — the bridge between worker events and supervisor
 * wake-up. Wraps the raw inbox queue (in `store.ts`) with the
 * "fire a prompt at an idle supervisor" mechanism that makes
 * "session A watches session B" actually work without polling.
 *
 * Design:
 *   1. PULL primary: supervisor's LLM calls `orchestrate_read_inbox`
 *      to drain pending items. Items stay in the file (cap-evicted)
 *      so the REST UI can show recent activity even after the LLM
 *      consumed them.
 *   2. PUSH secondary: when an event enqueues AND the supervisor
 *      session is live AND idle (not currently streaming), we fire
 *      a tiny `[orchestration]` prompt at the supervisor so it
 *      starts a new turn that surfaces the items. If the supervisor
 *      is busy, the push skips — the items wait on the queue, and
 *      the supervisor's next prompt will see them via
 *      `orchestrate_read_inbox`.
 *   3. Recovery: when the supervisor's own `agent_end` fires (i.e.
 *      it just became idle), we check for pending items and PUSH
 *      again if any. Closes the "supervisor finished a turn but
 *      didn't call read_inbox" gap.
 *
 * All PUSH paths are best-effort: the queue is the source of truth.
 * A missed wake-up means the supervisor sees the items on its next
 * turn, not that the items vanish.
