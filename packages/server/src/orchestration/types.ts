/**
 * Session orchestration — types + constants.

 * A "supervisor" session has the `orchestrate_*` tool group enabled
 * and can spawn / observe / message / interrupt / kill / detach a set
 * of "worker" sessions. Workers are real first-class sessions (same
 * .jsonl on disk, same browser visibility) — the link is purely
 * forge-side metadata in `${FORGE_DATA_DIR}/session-orchestration.json`.
 *
 * Topology is strict hub-and-spoke: workers don't get the orchestrate
 * tools and have no way to enumerate or message other workers.
 * Enforcement is by tool-surface (the tools simply aren't there),
 * not by permission check at the registry layer.
 *
 * Depth is limited to 1: a worker cannot become a supervisor. Keeps
 * the worst case bounded against fork-bomb runaway prompts.
