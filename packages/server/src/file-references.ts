/**
 * Process `@<path>` references in user input. The chat input's
 * `@`-autocomplete inserts these markers; this helper transforms them
 * server-side before the prompt reaches pi's `session.prompt()`.
 *
 * Threshold-based design: small files get inlined as fenced code blocks
 * (the model has the content immediately, no tool round-trip); large
 * files stay as the literal `@<path>` reference (the model loads what
 * it needs via its read/grep/find tools, no context-burn on a 50 MB
 * log we'd otherwise inhale wholesale).
 *
 * The chat UI renders BOTH forms as collapsed file badges in the user
 * message bubble, so visually the user sees a chip either way; the
 * difference is purely whether the LLM has the content in-prompt or
 * has to fetch it.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 * - Markers must be at start-of-string OR preceded by whitespace
 *   (avoid expanding `email@example.com`).
 * - Two path forms accepted:
 *     `@<path>`               — greedy non-whitespace; common case.
 *     `@"<path with spaces>"` — anything that isn't a `"` or newline.
 * - Resolved against the project's workspace root via file-manager's
 *   path-traversal-safe `checkFileReference`. Four outcomes:
 *     inline    → file ≤ INLINE_THRESHOLD; replace marker with a
 *                  fenced code block. Language hint derived from
 *                  extension.
 *     defer     → file > INLINE_THRESHOLD; leave the literal `@<path>`
 *                  reference for the model to load on demand.
 *     directory → path is a directory; preserve the marker normalized
 *                  with a trailing `/` (e.g. `@src/components/`) so
 *                  the model can ls/find/grep it via its tools. We
 *                  intentionally do NOT bulk-embed directory contents
 *                  — large dirs would blow the context window, and
 *                  the model has cheap tools to explore on demand.
 *     error     → missing / outside root / binary. Replace marker
 *                  with `[@<path> not included: <reason>]` so neither
 *                  user nor model is left guessing.
 *
 * Multiple markers in one prompt are classified independently, then
 * inline candidates compete for a shared aggregate budget. See
 * `AGGREGATE_INLINE_BUDGET_BYTES` for the cap and the smallest-first
 * walk that keeps the degradation graceful.

 * which leaves comfortable headroom for the user's prose, the system
 * prompt, the model's response, and tool round-trips inside a 200K

 * sentence punctuation (`?`, `,`, `;`, `:`, `!`, `)`, `]`) followed by
 * whitespace or end-of-string isn't pulled into the path. Without
 * this, `@README.md?` matches `README.md?` and the server can't
 * resolve the file. The `.` is intentionally NOT in the strip set
