/**
 * Config export / import as a flat `.tar.gz`.
 *
 * What's included (and why):
 *   - `mcp.json`              — pi-forge-owned MCP server registry
 *   - `settings.json`         — pi-owned defaults (model, thinking level, skills patterns)
 *   - `models.json`           — pi-owned custom providers
 *   - `skills-overrides.json` — pi-forge-private per-project skill enable/disable state
 *   - `tool-overrides.json`   — pi-forge-private per-project tool enable/disable state
 *
 * The two `*-overrides.json` files live in `${FORGE_DATA_DIR}` (not
 * `${PI_CONFIG_DIR}` like the other three). They're included because
 * the user's per-project tool/skill toggle decisions are part of "the
 * pi-forge config a power-user wants to carry across installations" —
 * pairing a backup of `settings.json` (global skill patterns) without
 * also backing up the per-project overrides loses information.
 * `projectId`s in the overrides files are local UUIDs — re-importing
 * onto an installation with a different `projects.json` will leave
 * orphan entries that are silently ignored at session-create time.
 * Acceptable trade-off; the alternative (refusing to import overrides
 * when project IDs don't match) would defeat the point of carrying
 * per-project config across installs that share workspaces.
 *
 * What's deliberately EXCLUDED:
 *   - `auth.json` — provider API keys + OAuth tokens. OAuth tokens are
 *     installation-bound (a token issued for one pi-forge instance is
 *     not portable), and inline API keys are sensitive enough that
 *     bundling them into a download the user might forward by accident
 *     (Slack, Drive, ticket attachment) outweighs the convenience. The
 *     import flow tells the user to re-authenticate providers
 *     afterwards.
 *   - `projects.json` — installation-bound (project paths reference
 *     local disk locations that won't exist on the target machine).
 *   - The auto-generated `jwt-secret` and `password-hash` files —
 *     installation-bound, intentionally not portable.
 *
 * Archive layout: a flat tar with the files at the top level (no
 * leading directory). Importing rejects any entry that isn't one of
 * the allow-listed names — this is the only validation that matters
 * for safety, since the names map deterministically to disk targets.
 *
 * Atomic writes: each imported file lands in `<dst>.import.tmp` first,
 * then `rename`s into place — same shape config-manager / project-
 * manager already use, so a crash mid-import never produces a half-
 * written config file.
