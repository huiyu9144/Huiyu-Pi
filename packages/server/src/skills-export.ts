/**
 * Skills export / import as a flat `.tar.gz`.
 *
 * What's included: every file under `${piConfigDir}/skills/`. Skills
 * come in two shapes — single-file (`<name>.md`) or directory
 * (`<name>/SKILL.md` plus any assets the skill references). The
 * exporter mirrors the source tree verbatim; the importer extracts
 * back into the same shape.
 *
 * What's deliberately EXCLUDED on import: anything outside the skills
 * subtree. The tar is rooted AT the skills directory contents (no
 * leading `skills/` prefix), so an entry like `../auth.json` or
 * `/etc/passwd` is rejected by the path-safety filter before any
 * bytes touch disk.
 *
 * Two import shapes are supported by the route layer:
 *   - A single `.tar.gz` upload (this module's `importSkillsFromTar`).
 *   - A multi-file folder upload (`importSkillsFromFiles`) — when the
 *     user picks a folder via `<input webkitdirectory>` the browser
 *     sends one multipart entry per file with the relative path in the
 *     filename. Same safety rules apply: relative paths only, no
 *     traversal, regular files only.
 *
 * Restore policy: per-file `.tmp` + rename so a partially-uploaded
 * archive never leaves a half-written file behind. Directories are
 * created with `recursive: true` as needed. Existing files in the
 * skills tree are OVERWRITTEN — the export is the source of truth on
 * restore, mirroring the config-export contract.
