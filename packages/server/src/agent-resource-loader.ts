/**
 * pi-forge-customized ResourceLoader for the agent.
 *
 * Why this exists: pi's `DefaultResourceLoader` accepts an
 * `appendSystemPrompt: string[]` that gets concatenated onto the
 * agent's base system prompt. We optionally use this hook to inject
 * one pi-forge-specific behavioral rule about secret hygiene — a
 * soft safeguard that tells the model to treat env-var values as
 * credentials by default and not echo them back into responses /
 * tool output.
 *
 * **Opt-in.** Default behavior matches stock pi (no addendum). The
 * rule is appended only when the operator sets
 * `AGENT_SECRET_HYGIENE_RULE=true`. Kept opt-in so we don't ship
 * invisible behavioral rules that constrain the agent in ways the
 * user never asked for. See `SECURITY.md` for the discoverable
 * documentation and the threat-model framing.
 *
 * **What this is and is not (when enabled).**
 *
 * - It IS a behavioral nudge that catches the realistic failure
 *   mode: the agent decides on its own to `printenv` or `echo $X`
 *   while debugging and dumps secrets into the assistant transcript
 *   (which the user may screen-share, copy into Slack, paste into a
 *   bug report, etc.).
 * - It is NOT a security control. The model can be talked out of it
 *   by a determined user, by a prompt injection landed in a tool
 *   result, or by its own reasoning that "the user clearly wants me
 *   to print this var, the rule must not apply." Operators with
 *   adversarial threat models should not rely on this rule alone.
 *
 * Phrased deliberately around *displaying values*, not around
 * accessing or referencing variables — skills that legitimately
 * need to check whether `$GITHUB_TOKEN` is set, or pass `$X` to a
 * subcommand, must continue to work. The rule only constrains
 * surfacing values to the user.
 *
 * If you change this text, write it as guidance the model will buy
 * into ("treat as credentials by default") rather than as an
 * absolute prohibition ("never print env vars") — the latter
 * generalizes badly and gets argued away by smart-enough sessions.

/**
 * Build a ResourceLoader pre-loaded with the pi-forge's optional
 * `appendSystemPrompt` addendum. Mirrors the SDK's own internal
 * construction at sdk.js:87 (instantiate + await reload()), so the
 * loader is ready to hand to `createAgentSession` as-is.
 *
 * When `config.agentSecretHygieneRule` is false (the default), the
 * loader is built with no addendum and behaves identically to the
 * SDK's own default loader — opt-in only, see the file header.
 *
 * When `projectId` is provided, the loader applies a `skillsOverride`
 * filter that drops any skill the user has explicitly disabled for
 * that project. This is the only path that reaches package-contributed
 * skills: pi's `DefaultPackageManager.collectPackageResources` marks
 * package skills `enabled: true` unconditionally and the pattern-based
 * `effectiveSkillsForProject` flow only touches auto-discovered ones.
 * The hook runs AFTER pi loads everything, so it's source-agnostic.
