   * snapped back to 0, so the second request also got `seq = 1` and

   * dropped it. Symptom: "Add as @ context sometimes doesn't work."
   * The ratchet now lives on the producer side and survives clears.
   *
   * Underscore prefix is convention for "internal state — don't read
   * from components." Per-channel counters (rather than a single
   * shared one) keep each consumer's local lastSeen monotonic
   * without surprising jumps when an unrelated channel fires.
